    "In this lecture, we continue our study of the income fluctuation problem initiated in [an earlier lecture](ifp.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "(See that lecture for background and intuition.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we introduce two significant extensions to the version we first considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Returns on assets are allowed to be stochastic.  \n",
    "1. The discount factor of the agent is allowed to vary with the state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first modification makes our model more realistic in terms of content and predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second modification allows us to encompass recent quantitative work using heterogeneous agent models, which often adopts this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- See, for example, [[KS98]](zreferences.ipynb#krusell1998income),\n",

    "  [[HN18]](zreferences.ipynb#hills2018fiscal).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these generalizations of the income fluctuation problem, we also introduce an alternative method for solving such problems computationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is sometimes called **time iteration** and involves iterating on the Euler equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In one of our lectures, we use similar ideas to solve the optimal growth model.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can be shown to be globally convergent under mild assumptions, even when utility is unbounded (both above and below).\n",
